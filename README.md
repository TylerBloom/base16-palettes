## About
This is a simple crate that encodes all of the [Base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-schemes-source) palettes into Rust code.
A color is encoded in a universal representation that is then intrepretted into RGB and hex representation through a palette.

## Contributing
The currently supported palettes are those that are in the base16 repo's README.
A few of the listed themes are unavailable.
If you would like to have support added for your favorite missing theme, open an issue or PR.
